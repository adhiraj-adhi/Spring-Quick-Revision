(a) Bean Definition: A bean definition includes configuration metadata that the container needs to know to
create and manage the bean.

(b) Bean configuration:
    (i) Bean Definition can be provided in various ways inclding XML config files, annotations, and Java-based
    configuration.
    (ii) Beans are configured using XML files, where each bean is defined within the <bean> tag with attributes
    specifying class, properties, and dependencies.
    (iii) Beans can be configured using annotations like @Components, @Service, @Repository, etc., which are
    scanned by Spring and managed as beans.

(c) Lifecycle of Bean:

    (ii) Population of properties: Properties would be set on bean instance (either through setter method,
    constructor, or field injection).
    (iii) Initialization: Initialization related methods are invoked.
    (iv) Bean is ready to use
    (v) Destruction after use.
