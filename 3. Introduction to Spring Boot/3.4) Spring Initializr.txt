3.4) Spring Initializr:
==========================

=> It is tool used to generate a Spring Boot project with necessary starters. For this we can visit the 
"start.spring.io" website or we can simply search for Spring Boot Initializr.

=> Some terms to understand while generating projects via Spring Boot Initializr:
(i) SNAPSHOT:  It represents a version of the software that is still in development and not yet a final 
release. For example, 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT is a pre-release version of what will eventually become 1.0.0.

(ii) Group: The Group is a unique identifier for the project, typically representing our organization's 
domain name in reverse. Basically, it is package name.
(iii) Artifact: The Artifact is the name of our project or module. It is the identifier for the specific 
project within the group.
(iv) Name: The Name is a human-readable name for our project. It often defaults to the Artifact value but 
can be customized.

(v) We can add dependencies based on our requirements (say we add Spring Web dependency).
(vi) Explore: Gives a view of our project structure.

Note: Under src/main/java all our Java files resides and under src/main/resources we have our properties
files and user-facing things reside (like HTML, JSP, etc stuff).
