3.9) Making use of Path Variable (@PathVariable):
===================================================

=> Path Variable: Used to extract param (i.e. dynamic element) from URL. These dynamic elements are 
placeholders in the URL path that can change for different requests. We use @PathVariable for this.

=> Example:
@GetMapping("/hello/{username}")
public HelloResponse hello(@PathVariable String username) {
	/* Note: Here, name of dynamic field in URL (here, {username}) and name of 
	 * Path Variable must be same
	 */
	return new HelloResponse("Hello "+username);
}

=> Note: We can also have dynamic element between two static part of URL say as:
@GetMapping("/hello/{username}/show")
