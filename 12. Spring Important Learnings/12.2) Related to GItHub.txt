(12.2) Related to GItHub:
===========================

-> I created Readme file from git hub and did the commit. Next time after succesffully commiting the changes and then tried pushing the changes when
I tried pushing the code using the terminal, I got error because remote already has commits we donâ€™t have locally.
To handle this issue I run these commands step by step:
# 1. Fetch latest changes from remote
git fetch origin

# 2. Merge remote main into our local main
git pull origin main --rebase

# 3. Now push our commits
git push origin main
