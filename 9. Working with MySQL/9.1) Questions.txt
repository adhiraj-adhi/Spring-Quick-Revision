-> After running our program, we can see that we hava a table name "product_seq" created. Why?
That table is automatically created by Hibernate because of the way we annotated our Product entity’s 
id field. In our Product entity, we have something like:
@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO) // or, GenerationType.SEQUENCE
private Long id;

    - MySQL does not support real database sequences like Oracle or PostgreSQL.
    - Hibernate still needs a sequence-like mechanism if you use `SEQUENCE` or `AUTO`.
    - So Hibernate emulates sequences in MySQL by creating a special table, for example:
        - `product_seq` with one column `next_val`.
        - Hibernate increments `next_val` each time a new `Product` row is inserted.


- If we don’t want `product_seq`. For MySQL, the best practice is to use IDENTITY strategy:

@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
private Long id;
