(6.1) Introduction to pagination:
===================================

=> Pagination is a technique to split a large dataset into smaller, manageable chunks, often called "pages." This is particularly useful in APIs when dealing with large amounts of data to improve performance and user experience.


=> We can send pagination related data (a.k.a. pagination metadata) in our API call so that client can render specific page and its relevant data.

=> How we pass the request and what we get in response?
   (a) In request, we pass it using the query parameter as: page=1&limit=10
   (b) In response, we get the response as:
        {
            "Content": [
                {"categoryId": 1, "categoryName": "Book Title 1", "author": "Author Name 1"},
                {"categoryId": 2, "categoryName": "Book Title 2", "author": "Author Name 2"},
                // 8 more book entries...
            ],
            "pageNumber": 0,
            "pageSize": 10,
            "totalElements": 1000,
            "totalPages": 100,
            "lastPage": false
        }
