(10.1) Thinking about Cart Functionality:
===========================================
ðŸ“Œ Types of Shopping Carts:
1. Session-based Cart: Cart stored in user session.
    - Simple, good for small/low traffic sites.
    - Limitations:
        - Session expires â†’ cart lost.
        - Not accessible across devices (desktop â†’ mobile).

2. Cookie-based Cart: Cart stored in browser cookies.
    - Persists beyond one session.
    - Limitations:
        - Size restrictions as cookies size is limited.
        - Privacy/security concerns.
        - If cookies cleared â†’ cart lost.

3. Database-based Cart: Cart stored on the server-side database.
    - Advantages:
        - Persistent (data not lost after session expiry), scalable, secure.
        - Accessible across devices.
        - Supports advanced features like:
            - Cart recovery (reminder emails, offers).
            - Analytics (e.g., products often added but not bought).
            - Personalized recommendations.
            - Wish lists & Save for later.
            - Enables marketing campaigns (e.g., discount emails for products in cart).
    - Limitation: Slightly more complex to implement.
